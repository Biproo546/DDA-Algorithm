# DDA-Algorithm
The Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm is a line generation algorithm used in computer graphics to draw lines between two points. It is an incremental method that calculates intermediate points along the line path between the start and end points. The DDA algorithm is known for its simplicity and efficiency in rasterizing lines.
